# Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption Program

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Caesar Cipher algorithm in Python. The program allows users to encrypt or decrypt text using a fixed key with a shift value of 3.

## Introduction

The **Caesar Cipher** is one of the simplest encryption techniques. Each letter in the text is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. In this program, a fixed shift of `3` is used for both encryption and decryption.

The program provides a simple command-line interface where the user can choose to either encrypt or decrypt a given text or exit the program.

## Features

- Encrypt any text using a Caesar Cipher with a fixed key (shift value of 3).
- Decrypt an encrypted text using the same fixed key.
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase characters.
- Non-alphabetic characters (such as spaces and punctuation) are preserved.
- Simple command-line interface.

## Usage

To run the program, clone this repository and execute the Python script.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/caesar-cipher.git
cd caesar-cipher
python caesar_cipher.py
